         "To be fair, I was warned going in that this was Sanderson’s first novel. Maybe because of this it is not his best. Also, I should not judge everything by this book and, as a result, not want to read more of his books. So, my review of this book may be a little harsh, but there is no reason to lose hope . . .Ah, heck, I cannot keep this charade up!!!WHAT THE ACTUAL F!$%????If what the fans are saying is true about this “weakest” book and that I shouldn’t judge whether to move on based on this, I MUST BE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON THE MOST AMAZING SERIES OF MIND BLOWING FANTASY BOOKS EVER!I don’t think I need to say much more than this was GREAT, FANTASTIC, WELL DONE!  Sanderson has easily found himself a new fan. And, if it only goes up from here . . . well, I guess I am in for a real treat!(Yes, Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~, all of those ellipses are for you for not having more faith in your author! ;););))",

         "3.5/5 StarsExactly 3 months ago, I finished binge reading the two available books in the Stormlight Archive series, Brandon Sanderson’s magnum opus and my favorite series of all time. By that time, I already caught up to all Sanderson’s Cosmere works (excluding novellas) except his debut work, Elantris. Today, I finished it and in my opinion, it’s a great debut novel but at the same time it’s also Sanderson’s weakest Cosmere’s book. Once you read all his other books, it’s really clear that this is his debut work, whether from his writing or the way he weaved the world-building and magic systems.Although this debut is inferior in comparison to his other Cosmere books, this doesn’t mean that it’s not great. Elantris has got to be one of the most unique and original fantasy books I ever read. The plot starts with the explanation of the city Elantris, the beautiful city of the gods full with magical abilities and dazzling architecture, which loses all its power and beauty 10 years ago. Then one of the three main characters, Raoden, inflicted with the same curse that ravaged Elantris were exiled to the city. The city of Elantris is pretty much a twist to the ‘zombie apocalypse’ genre and it contained really strong and eerie atmosphere.90% of the plot in the book revolves heavily around politics and religious exploration, it’s really slow paced and there aren’t any ‘Good vs Evil’ theme going on here. It’s really scarce on actions, more or less 5% of the book, it’s only there during the climax and yet, conflicted with these circumstances, Elantris still managed to be remain captivating and engrossing because of how intricate and intriguing the politics and religious aspects are.The story is told sequentially from 3 main POV, Raoden -> Sarene -> Hrathen, in that order from the beginning until the end and all the main characters possessed different narratives to each other. Raoden, the prince oozing with positive attitude (who in my opinion has the personality mixture of Kelsier from Mistborn and Hadrian from Riyria), Sarene, the strong and witty female MC and Hrathen, the fanatic high priest, all three characters never sounded the same in their narratives and they added a better experience to the plot.Raoden casting AonDorTwo problems I have with the book are in its world-building and magic systems. The writing is good and immersive enough but clearly if you’ve read all other Sanderson’s Cosmere works, you’ll see just how inferior his writing is compared to them. This means Sanderson always improves with each books he wrote but for this standalone, the scope of the world-building seems constricted, taking place in two big cities of the world of Sel, with the exception of Elantris, there isn’t enough world building done to the settings which made them seemed really small. This holds true especially to the city of Kae, the details were given probably only to two or three mansions and the dock of the city.Also, the magic systems, which are usually one of the strongest factors of Sanderson’s books is quite underwhelming. The magic of AonDor, ClayShan and Dakhor all made their appearance only in the last 60 pages of the book. AonDor have several intricate explanations on how it works but ClayShan and Dakhor were just there within the climax section of the book with very brief to zero explanation to what they actually are and how they operates. It felt like Sanderson tried to cram too much information into this standalone even though there aren’t enough pages left to do justice towards it.\n  “Remember, the past need not become our future as well.”\nThis quote summed up exactly what I think of Elantris's quality in comparison to all other Sanderson’s future works. While still great as a debut, it’s also his weakest book in his Cosmere universe. I really enjoyed reading it, it's different from his other book, lower in quality but it's one of the most original fantasy works I ever read. If you haven’t read any Sanderson’s adult fantasy books, Elantris or Mistborn is a great place to start. You can't go wrong with anyone of them, Elantris is pretty much just an appetizer to what’s in store for all his other phenomenal books. Recommended for any high fantasy fans who's into intricate politics and religious exploration story.You can also find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest",

         "4.31!“Remember, the past need not become our future as well.”\nBrandons debut novel is one of the best fantasies out there. I am just amazed to read a debut novel with this unique of a concept, I agree the prose is a little hard to read because its not at the level of his other book but still I appreciated so much and the graphic audios helped with this reread so much so I was very happy with how it went, before it was my least favorite brando book sitting at 4 stars lol but its definitely higher than that now also I loved how he dedicates so much time into planning and draws this book at an angsty pace with politics and a whole lotta foreshadowing, everyones favorite mystery character jumping out and making a cameo!! and then bang! he drops big ass sanderlanche's and everything is just boom!! \n  “Do not dash if you only have the strength to walk, and do not waste your time pushing on the walls that will not give. More importantly, don't shove where a pat would be sufficient.”\nWe follow our three main characters, Raoden, who gets the shaed/shaoed a week before his marriage ( a disease or a curse placed on elantrians which causes them to rot) he is thrown into Elantris a once luxurious city of gods now a cursed, abandoned, rotten place and now has to survive, I would say his arc was very fun to read it also was the highest cosmere connective so that was fun but it also reminded me of Kaladin a lot so I was so satisfied with it! Selenewas the princess bride supposed to marry (contractually married) to Raoden. N when I saw fmc's, she is what I mean because oh my god? she was so mischievous and fun to read about the way she entered politics in such a sly manner and got her way and got all her answers, who is this diva?? Hrathen A man trying to convert people of another city and claim it, is a very complex morally grey character, you wont understand his motives until the very end but you would feel for him, he is such a well take and such an interesting character to read about. He actually makes you question so much lmao!! loved him.\n  “To live is to have worries and uncertainties. Keep them inside, and they will destroy you for certain--leaving behind a person so callused that emotion can find no root in his heart.”\nThe worldbuilding, plotting, and magic systems were easily the best moments about this book because how did he craft this world with such a complex magic system and one so eroded but still so beautiful and made it so vivid that it was so hard not to imagine it!! The way it was weaved around politics and created such a spectacular plot, I do agree with it being too drawn out but oh my god the fall of elantris literally gave me chills ooof amd let me just appreciate how well written the politics was like it had me invested actually also the main conflict being based around an outbreak and me reading this during covid hit way too hard lmao\n  “The problem with being clever, Serene thought with a sigh, is that everyone assumes you're always planning something.”\nthe romance was minimal, there was some and cute also but not a lot.overall, not for everyone and slow but really good, would recommend graphic audio.__It's been four years since I last read it and I am so excited to read it because 1, I have the graphic audios. 2, my reread for SA is next. 3, I'm br this with Hoda.Reread #1",

         "Oh my God this is so contrary to my usual love of shorter novels.Okay so I knew that I had missed something in my review pot, I just realized now that I had missed this book.But there is a Persian saying that says \"the fish is fresh whenever you catch it from the water\", so let's go with that. This book is very different, but then again it is Brandon Sanderson, so anything less would be shocking. Elantris is simply said a rather ecstatically unique book, that creates a world beyond the usual bounds of imagination that thirsts for expansion into something even grander. There are times when you think \"it doesn't get any better than this\", that is where you would be absolutely wrong. The book revolves around a young prince cursed to the immortal tragedy that is Elantris, and a young yet slightly misfit feminist princess (who I adored) . A world of Gods and grandeur that now plagued by an unknown curse is depleted of its magic and plunged into suffering. The sufferings include the inability to die and along with it the inability to heal. Where a simple bump to the arm can become an eternal pain that never leaves you, and when the pain is enough it sends you into an delirious limbo.The ideas were erratic and profound, but in the best way possible. They were daring and incredible, and that is why one must simply fall into the world of Sanderson and accept that leaving it without being marked for life is simply not an option. The book hung somewhere between high fantasy and paranormal, never quite surrendering to either. I can't really express how much I adored this book, I usually don't like overtly descriptive books, with excessive amounts of narration. I feel like these books cage the imagination, but that is simply my personal opinion. That wasn't the case here, obviously. In this book the word excessive had no place, it simply worked out in the best way possible. I hope I find time to read how the tale of Elantris will continue real soon! But 2020? What?!",

         "Oh, Elantris, why must you torture me so? Why must you force me into conflict with the library, my favorite dealer? They claim I owe them, and they aren't going to leave me alone. I'm afraid to go to the corner dropbox at night in case a librarian is lurking. I've stubbornly held onto their copy of Elantris hoping that I would become inspired to re-read and provide a more thorough review. Alas, no. You will have to read my generalized dislike instead of many specific examples. For no clear reason, I was completely unable to sustain interest in Elantris despite leaving the library copy on my physical 'currently reading' shelf for months. While there is an interesting vision of a magical system, magic isn't enough to save the story, especially as the re-discovering of Elantrian magic is so slooow in the making. Out of the triplicate storyline, the destroyed Elantrian city was the only plot that really sustained my focus. Perhaps part of it was a difficulty connecting with any of the characters who were mostly out of the Campbellian Mythical Archetype lineage. Prince Raoden has been declared dead, but has actually been thrown into slime-coated Elantris. He has undergone the random but incomplete transformation into an Elantrian. However, he brings his royal training, knowledge of various Arelon citizens and unflagging optimism to the destroyed city and starts gathering the hopeless citizens into a band of survivors. He has a vision--plans to forge them into a populace with pride. He is going to scrub the slime from the buildings and recognize that even the street-sweepers have value in society. He's going to study, at least the books that haven't been eaten by the starving populace. He's going to make friends with a Jamaican friend and adviser, Galladon. He's going to fix things.A second storyline is focused an an annoyingly plucky young heroine, Sarene (subtle much?)--saved from being a Mary Sue because, you know, she can't draw. Or sing. I think. She's been betrothed to the prince of Arelon as part of an alliance between her kingdom and his. She faces somewhat predictable kingdom politics, as well as--gasp--overt sexism from her father-in-law and the generally patriarchal Arelon society. But don't worry--she'll modernize them and teach them that real princess can fight using swords. The final storyline is focused on Hrathen, a high priest from Fjordell who is in a mission to convert the godless in Arelon before his emperor invades. He's actually one of the most layered characters because he has the zeal of a believer tempered with flawed insight. Though he thinks he knows the politics, he's frequently outmaneuvered by everyone around him, from Sarene, to his recruit, to the emperor. However, the subtlety of his characterization is based on overly-fuzzy political details, so there is a tremendous amount of info-dumping whenever he is in a scene, likely one reason a number of readers label it their least favorite storyline.I just didn't feel the heart here, ultimately leading it to a two star read for me. It felt a little too self-conscious and 'I'm-avoiding-formula-by-changing-two-things' on Sanderson's part. There are a couple of unsolved questions, at least as far as my half-a-brain effort could tell, but I'm not sure there's anything worth potential conflict with the library. After all, I have to stay on the good side of my dealer.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0...",
