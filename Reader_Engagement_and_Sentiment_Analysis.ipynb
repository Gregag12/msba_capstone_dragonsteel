    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores reader engagement and sentiment toward books published by Dragonsteel Entertainment, founded by fantasy author Brandon Sanderson. The goal is to use data analytics to uncover patterns in reader behavior, preferences, and sentiment — insights that could support marketing, publishing strategy, and fan engagement initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this analysis was collected using a combination of web scraping and API-based methods from publicly available sources such as Goodreads. The scraping process followed ethical data collection practices, targeting only non-private and non-restricted information. The dataset consists of two primary components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Book Details Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides structured information about each Dragonsteel-related title. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Author* – Primary author or contributing authors.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Title* – Full title of the book or series entry.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Publication Date* – Original publication or release date.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Audience Genre* – Primary target audience (e.g., Adult, Young Adult).\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Description* – Short synopsis of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Average Rating* – Mean reader rating on Goodreads.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Total Ratings* – Number of total ratings submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Total Reviews* – Number of written reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Non-Audience Genres* – Secondary genres or tags associated with the book.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Currently Reading Count* – Number of users currently reading the book.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Want to Read Count* – Number of users who have added the book to their “to read” list.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Goodreads Book URL* – Direct link to the book’s Goodreads page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset forms the foundation for understanding the overall popularity, reach, and thematic positioning of each title within the Dragonsteel catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Book Reviews Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset captures qualitative and quantitative aspects of reader reviews. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Review Rating* – The individual rating (1–5 stars).\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Review Text* – The written content of each review.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Number of Likes* – Community engagement with each review.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Review Length* – Number of characters in the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Book Title* – Title of the book being reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Word Count* – Total number of words in the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset enables analysis of reader sentiment, emotional tone, and engagement depth — offering a more nuanced perspective on how readers respond to different works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these datasets support a comprehensive exploration of how readers interact with Dragonsteel’s works — from overall popularity metrics to individual emotional responses. Through data visualization, sentiment analysis, and pattern discovery, this project aims to reveal meaningful insights into fan engagement and the storytelling impact of Brandon Sanderson’s literary universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consists of three main components: \n",
    "1. Data Collection:\n",
    "    - **Details_Scraper.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that scrapes key book-level metadata (e.g., title, author, genres, ratings, and counts) from Goodreads.\n",
    "    - **Review_Scraper.ipynb**: A complementary scraper that collects individual review data for each title, including rating, review text, likes, and length.\n",
    "        - Each book’s reviews were saved as a separate CSV file (e.g., **reviews_Elantris.csv**, **reviews_Final_Empire.csv**) to simplify troubleshooting and incremental updates during scraping.\n",
    "2. Data Consolidation and Cleaning:\n",
    "    - **Combine_CSVs.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that merges all individual review CSVs into a single dataset, standardizing column names and cleaning inconsistencies. It was used to combine review CSVs and then changed to combine detail CSVs.\n",
    "        - The end results were **Combined_Details.csv** and **Combined_Reviews.csv**\n",
    "    - **Cleanup.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that cleans both colsolidated CSVs\n",
    "3. Exploration and Analysis:"
