Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping\\u2014based on their correspondence\\u2014to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star in the constellation of fantasy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Average Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.28500901361994063,\n        \"min\": 3.5,\n        \"max\": 4.76,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 43,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Total Ratings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 190868,\n        \"min\": 2031,\n        \"max\": 937774,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          339619\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Total Reviews\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 15384,\n        \"min\": 399,\n        \"max\": 77642,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25241\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Non-Audience Genres\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Science Fiction, Fantasy, Short Stories, Fiction, Novella, Space\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Currently Reading\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 13858,\n        \"min\": 24,\n        \"max\": 66180,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          14021\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Want to Read\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 152267,\n        \"min\": 1150,\n        \"max\": 892382,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          223718\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zVCbNgmRcAsL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762487460852,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":16348,"user":{"displayName":"Greg Garrett","userId":"11172971273733290464"}},"outputId":"aaf55854-6c79-42e9-f4e5-5f8e1e88df7a"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["book_df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/School/MSBA Program/ANLY 6900 - Capstone Project/Goodreads_Scraped_Data/Combined_Detals_v2.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"QUAmxJ9lcAxZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762487678875,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2050,"user":{"displayName":"Greg Garrett","userId":"11172971273733290464"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]}]}
