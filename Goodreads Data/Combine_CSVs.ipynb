By that time, I already caught up to all Sanderson\\u2019s Cosmere works (excluding novellas) except his debut work, Elantris. Today, I finished it and in my opinion, it\\u2019s a great debut novel but at the same time it\\u2019s also Sanderson\\u2019s weakest Cosmere\\u2019s book. Once you read all his other books, it\\u2019s really clear that this is his debut work, whether from his writing or the way he weaved the world-building and magic systems.Although this debut is inferior in comparison to his other Cosmere books, this doesn\\u2019t mean that it\\u2019s not great. Elantris has got to be one of the most unique and original fantasy books I ever read. The plot starts with the explanation of the city Elantris, the beautiful city of the gods full with magical abilities and dazzling architecture, which loses all its power and beauty 10 years ago. Then one of the three main characters, Raoden, inflicted with the same curse that ravaged Elantris were exiled to the city. The city of Elantris is pretty much a twist to the \\u2018zombie apocalypse\\u2019 genre and it contained really strong and eerie atmosphere.90% of the plot in the book revolves heavily around politics and religious exploration, it\\u2019s really slow paced and there aren\\u2019t any \\u2018Good vs Evil\\u2019 theme going on here. It\\u2019s really scarce on actions, more or less 5% of the book, it\\u2019s only there during the climax and yet, conflicted with these circumstances, Elantris still managed to be remain captivating and engrossing because of how intricate and intriguing the politics and religious aspects are.The story is told sequentially from 3 main POV, Raoden -> Sarene -> Hrathen, in that order from the beginning until the end and all the main characters possessed different narratives to each other. Raoden, the prince oozing with positive attitude (who in my opinion has the personality mixture of Kelsier from Mistborn and Hadrian from Riyria), Sarene, the strong and witty female MC and Hrathen, the fanatic high priest, all three characters never sounded the same in their narratives and they added a better experience to the plot.Raoden casting AonDorTwo problems I have with the book are in its world-building and magic systems. The writing is good and immersive enough but clearly if you\\u2019ve read all other Sanderson\\u2019s Cosmere works, you\\u2019ll see just how inferior his writing is compared to them. This means Sanderson always improves with each books he wrote but for this standalone, the scope of the world-building seems constricted, taking place in two big cities of the world of Sel, with the exception of Elantris, there isn\\u2019t enough world building done to the settings which made them seemed really small. This holds true especially to the city of Kae, the details were given probably only to two or three mansions and the dock of the city.Also, the magic systems, which are usually one of the strongest factors of Sanderson\\u2019s books is quite underwhelming. The magic of AonDor, ClayShan and Dakhor all made their appearance only in the last 60 pages of the book. AonDor have several intricate explanations on how it works but ClayShan and Dakhor were just there within the climax section of the book with very brief to zero explanation to what they actually are and how they operates. It felt like Sanderson tried to cram too much information into this standalone even though there aren\\u2019t enough pages left to do justice towards it.\\n\\u201cRemember, the past need not become our future as well.\\u201d\\nThis quote summed up exactly what I think of Elantris's quality in comparison to all other Sanderson\\u2019s future works. While still great as a debut, it\\u2019s also his weakest book in his Cosmere universe. I really enjoyed reading it, it's different from his other book, lower in quality but it's one of the most original fantasy works I ever read. If you haven\\u2019t read any Sanderson\\u2019s adult fantasy books, Elantris or Mistborn is a great place to start. You can't go wrong with anyone of them, Elantris is pretty much just an appetizer to what\\u2019s in store for all his other phenomenal books. Recommended for any high fantasy fans who's into intricate politics and religious exploration story.You can also find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest\",\n          \"Oh, Elantris, why must you torture me so? Why must you force me into conflict with the library, my favorite dealer? They claim I owe them, and they aren't going to leave me alone. I'm afraid to go to the corner dropbox at night in case a librarian is lurking. I've stubbornly held onto their copy of Elantris hoping that I would become inspired to re-read and provide a more thorough review. Alas, no. You will have to read my generalized dislike instead of many specific examples. For no clear reason, I was completely unable to sustain interest in Elantris despite leaving the library copy on my physical 'currently reading' shelf for months. While there is an interesting vision of a magical system, magic isn't enough to save the story, especially as the re-discovering of Elantrian magic is so slooow in the making. Out of the triplicate storyline, the destroyed Elantrian city was the only plot that really sustained my focus. Perhaps part of it was a difficulty connecting with any of the characters who were mostly out of the Campbellian Mythical Archetype lineage. Prince Raoden has been declared dead, but has actually been thrown into slime-coated Elantris. He has undergone the random but incomplete transformation into an Elantrian. However, he brings his royal training, knowledge of various Arelon citizens and unflagging optimism to the destroyed city and starts gathering the hopeless citizens into a band of survivors. He has a vision--plans to forge them into a populace with pride. He is going to scrub the slime from the buildings and recognize that even the street-sweepers have value in society. He's going to study, at least the books that haven't been eaten by the starving populace. He's going to make friends with a Jamaican friend and adviser, Galladon. He's going to fix things.A second storyline is focused an an annoyingly plucky young heroine, Sarene (subtle much?)--saved from being a Mary Sue because, you know, she can't draw. Or sing. I think. She's been betrothed to the prince of Arelon as part of an alliance between her kingdom and his. She faces somewhat predictable kingdom politics, as well as--gasp--overt sexism from her father-in-law and the generally patriarchal Arelon society. But don't worry--she'll modernize them and teach them that real princess can fight using swords. The final storyline is focused on Hrathen, a high priest from Fjordell who is in a mission to convert the godless in Arelon before his emperor invades. He's actually one of the most layered characters because he has the zeal of a believer tempered with flawed insight. Though he thinks he knows the politics, he's frequently outmaneuvered by everyone around him, from Sarene, to his recruit, to the emperor. However, the subtlety of his characterization is based on overly-fuzzy political details, so there is a tremendous amount of info-dumping whenever he is in a scene, likely one reason a number of readers label it their least favorite storyline.I just didn't feel the heart here, ultimately leading it to a two star read for me. It felt a little too self-conscious and 'I'm-avoiding-formula-by-changing-two-things' on Sanderson's part. There are a couple of unsolved questions, at least as far as my half-a-brain effort could tell, but I'm not sure there's anything worth potential conflict with the library. After all, I have to stay on the good side of my dealer.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0...\",\n          \"4.31!\\u201cRemember, the past need not become our future as well.\\u201d\\nBrandons debut novel is one of the best fantasies out there. I am just amazed to read a debut novel with this unique of a concept, I agree the prose is a little hard to read because its not at the level of his other book but still I appreciated so much and the graphic audios helped with this reread so much so I was very happy with how it went, before it was my least favorite brando book sitting at 4 stars lol but its definitely higher than that now also I loved how he dedicates so much time into planning and draws this book at an angsty pace with politics and a whole lotta foreshadowing, everyones favorite mystery character jumping out and making a cameo!! and then bang! he drops big ass sanderlanche's and everything is just boom!! \\n\\u201cDo not dash if you only have the strength to walk, and do not waste your time pushing on the walls that will not give. More importantly, don't shove where a pat would be sufficient.\\u201d\\nWe follow our three main characters, Raoden, who gets the shaed/shaoed a week before his marriage ( a disease or a curse placed on elantrians which causes them to rot) he is thrown into Elantris a once luxurious city of gods now a cursed, abandoned, rotten place and now has to survive, I would say his arc was very fun to read it also was the highest cosmere connective so that was fun but it also reminded me of Kaladin a lot so I was so satisfied with it! Selenewas the princess bride supposed to marry (contractually married) to Raoden. N when I saw fmc's, she is what I mean because oh my god? she was so mischievous and fun to read about the way she entered politics in such a sly manner and got her way and got all her answers, who is this diva?? Hrathen A man trying to convert people of another city and claim it, is a very complex morally grey character, you wont understand his motives until the very end but you would feel for him, he is such a well take and such an interesting character to read about. He actually makes you question so much lmao!! loved him.\\n\\u201cTo live is to have worries and uncertainties. Keep them inside, and they will destroy you for certain--leaving behind a person so callused that emotion can find no root in his heart.\\u201d\\nThe worldbuilding, plotting, and magic systems were easily the best moments about this book because how did he craft this world with such a complex magic system and one so eroded but still so beautiful and made it so vivid that it was so hard not to imagine it!! The way it was weaved around politics and created such a spectacular plot, I do agree with it being too drawn out but oh my god the fall of elantris literally gave me chills ooof amd let me just appreciate how well written the politics was like it had me invested actually also the main conflict being based around an outbreak and me reading this during covid hit way too hard lmao\\n\\u201cThe problem with being clever, Serene thought with a sigh, is that everyone assumes you're always planning something.\\u201d\\nthe romance was minimal, there was some and cute also but not a lot.overall, not for everyone and slow but really good, would recommend graphic audio.__It's been four years since I last read it and I am so excited to read it because 1, I have the graphic audios. 2, my reread for SA is next. 3, I'm br this with Hoda.Reread #1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"likes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 118,\n        \"min\": 146,\n        \"max\": 473,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          473,\n          277,\n          349\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1363,\n        \"min\": 907,\n        \"max\": 4376,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4376,\n          3450,\n          3338\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"book_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Elantris\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There area lot of word_counts that weren't calculated when the original code was run for the web scraper.

By that time, I already caught up to all Sanderson\\u2019s Cosmere works (excluding novellas) except his debut work, Elantris. Today, I finished it and in my opinion, it\\u2019s a great debut novel but at the same time it\\u2019s also Sanderson\\u2019s weakest Cosmere\\u2019s book. Once you read all his other books, it\\u2019s really clear that this is his debut work, whether from his writing or the way he weaved the world-building and magic systems.Although this debut is inferior in comparison to his other Cosmere books, this doesn\\u2019t mean that it\\u2019s not great. Elantris has got to be one of the most unique and original fantasy books I ever read. The plot starts with the explanation of the city Elantris, the beautiful city of the gods full with magical abilities and dazzling architecture, which loses all its power and beauty 10 years ago. Then one of the three main characters, Raoden, inflicted with the same curse that ravaged Elantris were exiled to the city. The city of Elantris is pretty much a twist to the \\u2018zombie apocalypse\\u2019 genre and it contained really strong and eerie atmosphere.90% of the plot in the book revolves heavily around politics and religious exploration, it\\u2019s really slow paced and there aren\\u2019t any \\u2018Good vs Evil\\u2019 theme going on here. It\\u2019s really scarce on actions, more or less 5% of the book, it\\u2019s only there during the climax and yet, conflicted with these circumstances, Elantris still managed to be remain captivating and engrossing because of how intricate and intriguing the politics and religious aspects are.The story is told sequentially from 3 main POV, Raoden -> Sarene -> Hrathen, in that order from the beginning until the end and all the main characters possessed different narratives to each other. Raoden, the prince oozing with positive attitude (who in my opinion has the personality mixture of Kelsier from Mistborn and Hadrian from Riyria), Sarene, the strong and witty female MC and Hrathen, the fanatic high priest, all three characters never sounded the same in their narratives and they added a better experience to the plot.Raoden casting AonDorTwo problems I have with the book are in its world-building and magic systems. The writing is good and immersive enough but clearly if you\\u2019ve read all other Sanderson\\u2019s Cosmere works, you\\u2019ll see just how inferior his writing is compared to them. This means Sanderson always improves with each books he wrote but for this standalone, the scope of the world-building seems constricted, taking place in two big cities of the world of Sel, with the exception of Elantris, there isn\\u2019t enough world building done to the settings which made them seemed really small. This holds true especially to the city of Kae, the details were given probably only to two or three mansions and the dock of the city.Also, the magic systems, which are usually one of the strongest factors of Sanderson\\u2019s books is quite underwhelming. The magic of AonDor, ClayShan and Dakhor all made their appearance only in the last 60 pages of the book. AonDor have several intricate explanations on how it works but ClayShan and Dakhor were just there within the climax section of the book with very brief to zero explanation to what they actually are and how they operates. It felt like Sanderson tried to cram too much information into this standalone even though there aren\\u2019t enough pages left to do justice towards it.\\n\\u201cRemember, the past need not become our future as well.\\u201d\\nThis quote summed up exactly what I think of Elantris's quality in comparison to all other Sanderson\\u2019s future works. While still great as a debut, it\\u2019s also his weakest book in his Cosmere universe. I really enjoyed reading it, it's different from his other book, lower in quality but it's one of the most original fantasy works I ever read. If you haven\\u2019t read any Sanderson\\u2019s adult fantasy books, Elantris or Mistborn is a great place to start. You can't go wrong with anyone of them, Elantris is pretty much just an appetizer to what\\u2019s in store for all his other phenomenal books. Recommended for any high fantasy fans who's into intricate politics and religious exploration story.You can also find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest\",\n          \"Oh, Elantris, why must you torture me so? Why must you force me into conflict with the library, my favorite dealer? They claim I owe them, and they aren't going to leave me alone. I'm afraid to go to the corner dropbox at night in case a librarian is lurking. I've stubbornly held onto their copy of Elantris hoping that I would become inspired to re-read and provide a more thorough review. Alas, no. You will have to read my generalized dislike instead of many specific examples. For no clear reason, I was completely unable to sustain interest in Elantris despite leaving the library copy on my physical 'currently reading' shelf for months. While there is an interesting vision of a magical system, magic isn't enough to save the story, especially as the re-discovering of Elantrian magic is so slooow in the making. Out of the triplicate storyline, the destroyed Elantrian city was the only plot that really sustained my focus. Perhaps part of it was a difficulty connecting with any of the characters who were mostly out of the Campbellian Mythical Archetype lineage. Prince Raoden has been declared dead, but has actually been thrown into slime-coated Elantris. He has undergone the random but incomplete transformation into an Elantrian. However, he brings his royal training, knowledge of various Arelon citizens and unflagging optimism to the destroyed city and starts gathering the hopeless citizens into a band of survivors. He has a vision--plans to forge them into a populace with pride. He is going to scrub the slime from the buildings and recognize that even the street-sweepers have value in society. He's going to study, at least the books that haven't been eaten by the starving populace. He's going to make friends with a Jamaican friend and adviser, Galladon. He's going to fix things.A second storyline is focused an an annoyingly plucky young heroine, Sarene (subtle much?)--saved from being a Mary Sue because, you know, she can't draw. Or sing. I think. She's been betrothed to the prince of Arelon as part of an alliance between her kingdom and his. She faces somewhat predictable kingdom politics, as well as--gasp--overt sexism from her father-in-law and the generally patriarchal Arelon society. But don't worry--she'll modernize them and teach them that real princess can fight using swords. The final storyline is focused on Hrathen, a high priest from Fjordell who is in a mission to convert the godless in Arelon before his emperor invades. He's actually one of the most layered characters because he has the zeal of a believer tempered with flawed insight. Though he thinks he knows the politics, he's frequently outmaneuvered by everyone around him, from Sarene, to his recruit, to the emperor. However, the subtlety of his characterization is based on overly-fuzzy political details, so there is a tremendous amount of info-dumping whenever he is in a scene, likely one reason a number of readers label it their least favorite storyline.I just didn't feel the heart here, ultimately leading it to a two star read for me. It felt a little too self-conscious and 'I'm-avoiding-formula-by-changing-two-things' on Sanderson's part. There are a couple of unsolved questions, at least as far as my half-a-brain effort could tell, but I'm not sure there's anything worth potential conflict with the library. After all, I have to stay on the good side of my dealer.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0...\",\n          \"4.31!\\u201cRemember, the past need not become our future as well.\\u201d\\nBrandons debut novel is one of the best fantasies out there. I am just amazed to read a debut novel with this unique of a concept, I agree the prose is a little hard to read because its not at the level of his other book but still I appreciated so much and the graphic audios helped with this reread so much so I was very happy with how it went, before it was my least favorite brando book sitting at 4 stars lol but its definitely higher than that now also I loved how he dedicates so much time into planning and draws this book at an angsty pace with politics and a whole lotta foreshadowing, everyones favorite mystery character jumping out and making a cameo!! and then bang! he drops big ass sanderlanche's and everything is just boom!! \\n\\u201cDo not dash if you only have the strength to walk, and do not waste your time pushing on the walls that will not give. More importantly, don't shove where a pat would be sufficient.\\u201d\\nWe follow our three main characters, Raoden, who gets the shaed/shaoed a week before his marriage ( a disease or a curse placed on elantrians which causes them to rot) he is thrown into Elantris a once luxurious city of gods now a cursed, abandoned, rotten place and now has to survive, I would say his arc was very fun to read it also was the highest cosmere connective so that was fun but it also reminded me of Kaladin a lot so I was so satisfied with it! Selenewas the princess bride supposed to marry (contractually married) to Raoden. N when I saw fmc's, she is what I mean because oh my god? she was so mischievous and fun to read about the way she entered politics in such a sly manner and got her way and got all her answers, who is this diva?? Hrathen A man trying to convert people of another city and claim it, is a very complex morally grey character, you wont understand his motives until the very end but you would feel for him, he is such a well take and such an interesting character to read about. He actually makes you question so much lmao!! loved him.\\n\\u201cTo live is to have worries and uncertainties. Keep them inside, and they will destroy you for certain--leaving behind a person so callused that emotion can find no root in his heart.\\u201d\\nThe worldbuilding, plotting, and magic systems were easily the best moments about this book because how did he craft this world with such a complex magic system and one so eroded but still so beautiful and made it so vivid that it was so hard not to imagine it!! The way it was weaved around politics and created such a spectacular plot, I do agree with it being too drawn out but oh my god the fall of elantris literally gave me chills ooof amd let me just appreciate how well written the politics was like it had me invested actually also the main conflict being based around an outbreak and me reading this during covid hit way too hard lmao\\n\\u201cThe problem with being clever, Serene thought with a sigh, is that everyone assumes you're always planning something.\\u201d\\nthe romance was minimal, there was some and cute also but not a lot.overall, not for everyone and slow but really good, would recommend graphic audio.__It's been four years since I last read it and I am so excited to read it because 1, I have the graphic audios. 2, my reread for SA is next. 3, I'm br this with Hoda.Reread #1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"likes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 118,\n        \"min\": 146,\n        \"max\": 473,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          473,\n          277,\n          349\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1363,\n        \"min\": 907,\n        \"max\": 4376,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4376,\n          3450,\n          3338\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"book_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Elantris\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 223.22253470472018,\n        \"min\": 180.0,\n        \"max\": 739.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          739.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"663de092","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762375198634,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5219,"user":{"displayName":"Greg Garrett","userId":"11172971273733290464"}},"outputId":"c70c3aed-fa32-4032-88ea-8bb9e9f3385b"},"source":["# Replace 'output.csv' with your desired output file name and path\n","output_file = '/content/drive/MyDrive/School/MSBA Program/ANLY 6900 - Capstone Project/Goodreads_Scraped_Data/Combined_Reviews.csv'\n","\n","# Save the combined DataFrame to a new CSV file\n","combined_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)\n","\n","print(f\"Combined data saved to {output_file}\")"],"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Combined data saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/School/MSBA Program/ANLY 6900 - Capstone Project/Goodreads_Scraped_Data/Combined_Reviews.csv\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/School/MSBA Program/ANLY 6900 - Capstone Project/Goodreads_Scraped_Data/Combined_Reviews.csv')\n","combined_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"q7b1dggMkE_B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762375202965,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2483,"user":{"displayName":"Greg Garrett","userId":"11172971273733290464"}},"outputId":"aeb018a1-41a8-46cc-c5a7-3c7e56c22cce"},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       rating                                        review_text  likes  \\\n","0         5.0  To be fair, I was warned going in that this wa...    146   \n","1         3.0  3.5/5 StarsExactly 3 months ago, I finished bi...    473   \n","2         4.0  4.31!“Remember, the past need not become our f...    349   \n","3         4.0  Oh my God this is so contrary to my usual love...    292   \n","4         2.0  Oh, Elantris, why must you torture me so?

A lot. She loves food even more than I do, which is saying something. Her journey as an Edgedancer is unique to the Stormlight Archive because of her circumstances. She's not a noble warrior or an honor-bound prince. She just wants to eat food and slide around using her awesomeness. I loved reading from her point of view. On the outside, she appears to be very flippant about the whole Radiant thing, but she actually cares a lot. She wants to find purpose, to help the forgotten. I've seen a lot of people say Lift is annoying, but I disagree. She's just a kid trying to survive and have fun. It's a pleasant break from the whole I'm So Serious And Honorable attitude we get from Kaladin and Dalinar.The setting wasn't Alethkar, which I was happy about. Sanderson is really good at building vibrant worlds, and he definitely displays his skills in this novella.5 starsBuddy read with John.\",\n          \"June 2022: Reread for the release of Bastille vs The Evil Librarians.-----------------------------------------------Aug 2016: Reread with BB&B for the release of The Dark TalentI think I don't have to keep saying how high my regard is for Brandon Sanderson is anymore. These middle grade books are quite game-changing. The fourth-wall breaking alone was not the reason - it was the approach and how Sanderson made tongue-in-cheek jabs at the writing profession in Alcatraz's voice as the narrator of his own book.--> Adults are not idiots. Often, in books such as this one, the opposite impression is given. Adults in those stories will either (a) get captured, (b) disappear conspicuously when there is trouble, or (c) refuse to help. (I\\u2019m not sure what authors have against adults, but everyone seems to hate them to an extent usually reserved for dogs and mothers. Why else make them out to be such idiots? \\u201cAh look, the dark lord of evil has come to attack the castle! Annnnd there\\u2019s my lunch break. Have fun saving the world on your own, kids!\\u201d)True story! --> Let\\u2019s talk about something called misdirection. In the last chapter, I told a big lie, then made you focus on it so much that you ignored the smaller lie. Again true story - how often as a reader do you catch on to misdirection with a slap to the forehead on hindsight? Hilarity aside, there is a seriousness underlying this book as Alcatraz discovered a bit more information about his lineage and started to notice possible connections between Smedrys and the Talents, and as well as between Oculatory and silimatic energies. There are also some life lessons smattered across his seemingly ridiculous chapter diversions. --> Expectations. We rely on them. That\\u2019s why so many Hushlanders have trouble believing in the Free Kingdoms and the Librarian conspiracy. You don\\u2019t expect to wake up and discover that everything you know about history, geography, and politics is wrong. So perhaps you can begin to see why I\\u2019ve included some of the things I have. Bunnies with bazookas, ships that get repaired (more on that later), faces made of numbers, editorials from short people about how we regard the world, and a lesson on shoes and fish. All of these examples try to prove that you need to have an open mind. Because not everything you believe is true, and not everything you expect to happen will.Of course, the reason behind these books is that we all need a good laugh.--> Laugh when good things happen. Laugh when bad things happen. Laugh when life is so plain boring that you can\\u2019t find anything amusing about it beyond the fact that it\\u2019s so utterly unamusing. Laugh when books come to a close, even if the endings aren\\u2019t happy.Can you tell that I highly recommend reading this book? If not, I'll leave you with this statement of fact which should be used to define the meaning of the name Brandon Sanderson. --> \\nIn fact, there are even natural laws relating to this book, my favorite of which is known as the Law of Pure Awesomeness. This law simply states that any book I write is awesome. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s a fact.\\n-----------------------------------Mar 2015: I liked this more than the first book - some of the solutions to the protagonist's predicaments are quite clever. Really good fun! The kind of book which you can pick up in the morning and finish it by the end of the day on a relaxing weekend.\",\n          \"Muy bien Brandon!! \\ud83d\\ude0bMuchos a\\u00f1os esperando la parte final (del primer arco) de la saga escuadr\\u00f3n. Brandon es mi autor favorito y con esta saga tuve una especie de relaci\\u00f3n amor odio, por suerte este cierre hace que me vaya con muy buena impresi\\u00f3n y muy contenta!Escuadr\\u00f3n fue lo primero que le\\u00ed del autor, y a medida que iba continuando con los libros sent\\u00eda que iba decayendo la calidad. Pero este cuarto libro logr\\u00f3 remontar y volver a eso que tanto me gustaba del libro 1, los personajes.Lo que lleva adelante la saga es definitivamente la protagonista. Podr\\u00e1n cambiar los personajes secundarios, los conflictos y la ambientaci\\u00f3n, pero es Spensa que sostiene estos 4 libros c\\u00f3mo una gran historia. Me gust\\u00f3 mucho ver c\\u00f3mo pudo crecer y madurar, destaco mucho el viaje y el crecimiento de spensa a lo largo de la saga. Si bien en tono de humor ella hace referencia a \\\"los grandes h\\u00e9roes de la historia\\\" creo que el autor lo hace a conciencia para mostrar ese mismo viaje del h\\u00e9roe en ella.En este cuarto libro Brandon logr\\u00f3 reunir TODO lo que hab\\u00eda desplegado en los tres libros anteriores para llegar a un cierre \\u00e9pico y emocionante. Me gust\\u00f3 mucho reencontrarme con viejos personajes y ver lo unidos que se ve\\u00edan todos. Era lo que entraba de la saga.El final fue emocionante y se me cay\\u00f3 alguna l\\u00e1grima, no les voy a mentir. Obviamente me dej\\u00f3 con ganas de m\\u00e1s, as\\u00ed que ya estoy en espera de Escuadr\\u00f3n Legado.Si tengo que hacer alg\\u00fan comentario para ustedes les dir\\u00eda que no es una saga para leer dejando pasar tiempo entre libro y libro. Porque se pierden muchos detalles. Mi consejo es que lean todo de corrido.
